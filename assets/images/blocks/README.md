## Cube Textures (Opaque)

### 1. `grass_top.png` - Fresh Spring Lawn
A bright, cheerful green that reminds you of fresh spring grass. Up close, you can see tiny variations in color—some patches slightly darker than others, just like real grass where some blades are in shade. It's the kind of grass that would feel cool and soft under your bare feet.

### 2. `grass_side.png` - The Edge of the Garden
Like looking at the side of a chunk of earth where grass grows on top. The top few rows are green and lively, but as your eye moves down, it messily transitions into rich, brown soil—like someone drew a jagged line where the grass stops and the earth begins. Very natural and unkempt.

### 3. `dirt.png - Rich Garden Soil
Dark, crumbly earth that would be perfect for planting. It has subtle clumps of slightly darker brown scattered throughout, like little patches of moisture or decomposed organic matter. Looks like the kind of dirt that would smell amazing after rain.

### 4. `stone.png - Weathered Cliff Face
Solid, reliable grey stone with character. There are darker speckles throughout, like mineral deposits, and a few thin cracks running through it—nothing structural, just the natural veins and stress marks you'd see in real rock. It feels ancient and sturdy.

### 5. `sand.png - Warm Beach Sand
A soft, warm tan color that immediately makes you think of sunshine and bare feet. Tiny darker grains are scattered throughout, just like real sand where not every grain is identical. It's the color of sand that's been baked warm by the afternoon sun.

### 6. `wood_side.png - Rough Tree Bark
The side of a tree trunk with deep, vertical grooves running down its length. The darker streaks every few pixels look like natural bark ridges, and the occasional extra-dark line could be where rainwater runs down or where the bark has naturally split. It's textured and tactile.

### 7. `wood_top.png - Freshly Cut Tree Stump
Looking straight down at a tree that's been recently cut. You can count its age by the concentric rings—like reading the tree's life story in circles. The center is slightly darker, the heartwood, where the tree was strongest. It still smells like fresh sawdust.

### 8. `water.png - Rippling Lake Surface
Calm blue water with gentle wave patterns running across it. Every few rows are slightly lighter, like sunlight catching the crest of tiny ripples. It's the kind of water you could skip stones across on a peaceful summer afternoon.

### 9. `iron_ore.png - Stone Veined with Promise
Grey rock speckled with rusty orange-brown patches where iron ore peeks through. Some spots have bright orange highlights, like fresh rust or a promising glint that makes a miner's heart skip a beat. Hidden treasure in plain rock.

### 10. `bedrock.png - The Unyielding Deep
Deep, dark, impossibly dense-looking rock. It's so dark it almost swallows light, with occasional lighter flecks like tiny mineral specks, and deeper pits of absolute blackness. This is the stuff that holds up the entire world—solid and immovable.

### 11. `chest_front.png - Sturdy Treasure Keeper
A warm wooden chest with a metallic latch right in the center. The wood has horizontal plank lines where separate boards were joined, and the latch is dark iron with a tiny keyhole—just waiting to be unlocked to reveal the treasures inside.

### 12. `chest_side.png - Simple Wooden Side
The side of a well-made chest, showing the edges of horizontal planks. Subtle vertical grain runs through the wood, and you can see where the planks were fitted together. It's simple, functional, and built to last.

### 13. `chest_top.png - The Lid Above
Looking at the top of a closed chest, with a slightly darker border around the edges where the lid meets the sides. There's a single plank line across the middle, and the wood is a shade lighter here—maybe from years of hands opening and closing it.

### 14. `crafting_table_top.png - The Maker's Workspace
A light wooden surface marked with a perfect grid—like a cutting guide for precise work. Each grid cell has a slightly lighter center, as if the surface has been worn smooth from countless projects. This is where ideas become things.

### 15. `crafting_table_side.png - Work-Worn and Honest
The side of a workbench that's seen heavy use. There are small tool marks and scratches in the lower half where boots have kicked it, and a few short diagonal cuts where a saw might have slipped. It's not perfect, but it's earned every mark.

### 16. `crafting_table_bottom.png - Unseen but Solid
The underside of the workbench—rough, simple, and no-nonsense. Nobody sees it, but it's still sturdy and well-made. A single plank line runs through it, and the wood is just a shade darker here in the shadows.

### 17. `furnace_front.png - The Heat Within
A stone face with a dark, sooty opening where the fire lives. The edges around the opening are darker from smoke, and inside, a faint orange glow and a single bright yellow pixel suggest a bed of hot coals still burning. You can almost feel the warmth radiating out.

### 18. `furnace_side.png - Rough-Hewn Stone
The side of a furnace made from rough cobblestones fitted together. Darker patches show where different stones meet, and thin cracks run between them—the natural expansion and contraction from years of heating and cooling.

### 19. `furnace_top.png - The Vent Above
The top of the furnace, with a dark square vent in the center where heat and smoke escape. The stone around it is slightly darker from constant exposure, and a faint orange glow deep inside the vent hints at the fire below, still working.

## Transparent Cube Texture

### 20. `leaves.png - Sun-Dappled Canopy
A lush cluster of dark green leaves with holes of sky showing through. About half the pixels are completely transparent, letting light filter down like through a real tree canopy. Some leaves are darker in shadow, others brighter where sun hits them—just like standing under a real tree on a sunny day.

## Cross-Billboard Textures (Transparent Background)

### 21. `berry_bush.png - Wild and Fruitful
A scraggly bush with dark green leaves and bright red berries peeking out. The bush shape is irregular and natural—not a perfect circle, but a real, wild tangle. Some berries are brighter than others, ripe and ready to pick. Looks like it was found at the edge of a forest.

### 22. `campfire.png - Cozy Evening Glow
A crackling fire built from a few stacked logs, with orange and yellow flames leaping up in jagged, natural shapes. The logs are dark and charred at the edges, and between them you can see the orange glow of embers. The flames are brightest at the center, fading to orange at the edges. Perfect for storytelling.

### 23. `torch.png - Light in the Dark
A simple wooden stick wrapped at the top with something flammable, burning with a bright, cheerful flame. The flame flickers from deep orange at the base to bright yellow at the tip, with irregular edges like real fire dancing in a breeze. It's the difference between darkness and safety.

### 24. `tall_grass.png - Whispering Meadow Blades
Three graceful grass blades swaying gently against the sky. The tallest blade stands proud in the center, reaching up from the ground with a subtle rightward curve at its tip—like it's bowing to the sun. To the left, a slightly shorter blade leans left in a relaxed arch, while its companion on the right stands more upright with just a hint of a lean. Each blade is a slightly different shade of green, just like real grass where no two are exactly alike. Their tips taper to delicate points, and you can almost hear them rustling in a warm summer breeze. It's the kind of grass you'd walk through barefoot, feeling it tickle your ankles.

### 25. `red_poppy.png - A Splash of Crimson
A delicate red poppy swaying on its slender green stem. The flower head is a brilliant, eye-catching red with a dark center, and tiny green leaves sprout from the stem. It's the kind of flower that stands out boldly against a field of green.

### 26. `dandelion.png - Sunshine in Bloom
A cheerful yellow dandelion head atop a simple green stem. The petals are slightly spiky and irregular, and the center is a deeper golden-orange. It's bright and happy—the kind of flower that makes you smile before it turns into a wish-making puffball.

### 27. `blue_orchid.png - Delicate and Rare
An elegant blue orchid with elongated petals and a lighter blue center. The green stem has two small leaves, and the whole flower has a delicate, almost exotic feel. It looks like something special, worth searching for.

### 28. `white_daisy.png - Simple and Sweet
A classic daisy with bright white petals radiating from a sunny yellow center. The petals are rounded like little scoops of vanilla ice cream, and the green stem is straight and true. It's friendly, familiar, and reminds you of summer meadows.
